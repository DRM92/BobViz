As part of our second year module in Software Engineering , we were required in teams to produce
a piece of software that could read in a CSV file and visualize the data as a series of charts. 
Charts we were required to produce included: Line Chart, Bar Chart, Bubble Chart and Pie Chart. 
To produce these charts we used the free Java library JFreeChart.
